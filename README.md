# PSEdgeRouterX
This is a PowerShell module to help working with the Ubiquite EdgeRouter X. This module is on no way endorsed, supported by or even related to Ubiquiti. Use at your own risk!! :smile:

## Get-Firewall
Used to generate Zone Based Firewall rules. The path to a configuration file must be supplied as a parameter. The configuration file must be a `.psd1` file. This file contains details of all the firewall rules that will be required. The output of this function is a String array of the commands to generate the firewall rules from the configuration file.

# Building 
While on the one hand this is a fairly straight-forward module, you will notice that there isn't a module manifest (`.psd1` file) stored in the repository - it is generated by psake. The psake build script uses GitVersion to calculate the version number.

## Get psake
You can get [psake](https://github.com/psake/psake) from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/psake), just run:
```
PS> Install-Module -Name psake
```

## Get GitVersion
You can get [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion) from [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/GitVersion.Portable), just run:
```
PS> choco install gitversion.portable 
```

## Build
Once the psake module can be imported and Gitversion is accessible on the path, run the following to build this module:
```
PS> Invoke-psake
```
